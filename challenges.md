Remove all magic strings and numbers.
Implement the necessary changes and additions to support Player vs Computer mode.
The current game is PvP (Player vs Player), but we want a functional Player vs Computer mode (accessed via the menu). The computer player you implement does not need to be smart, just functional. Note that there should still be a PvP mode, with PvC as an additional option.
Improve the gameboard's appearance and use colors for players (see img1.png for inspiration).
Update the splash screen graphics and include at least three colors.
Improve overall readability and maintainability by refactoring
